Supplementary Material of the manuscript "Potential distribution and richness gradient of phyllostomid bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in a subtropical Brazilian state"

We extracted the georeferenced occurrence records from specialized literature (Table S1), online databases (Brazilian Biodiversity Portal - https://portaldabiodiversidade.icmbio.gov.br/, SpeciesLink – http://splink.cria.org and GBIF Global Biodiversity Information Facility - https://www.gbif.org), zoological collections of universities (Regional University of Blumenau – FURB; and University of the Extreme South of Santa Catarina - UNESC), and unpublished records made by the authors;

Note that if only the name of the municipality of occurrence of a species was available, we used the centroid coordinates of this municipality, so that not all coordinates are accurate.
